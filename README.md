# Liquid Galaxy Retro Gaming

The Liquid Galaxy Retro Gaming is an app created with the intention of making the management of games in the Liquid Galaxy easier for any user. By simply installing the games and the LGRG server on your Liquid Galaxy master you can quickly launch and stop games on all screens and also get access to a specific controller for the chosen game and a QR code for other players to easily access the controller as well! More information about the installation of the games and the LGRG server can be found in the github repository which can be found by clicking the info icon on the top right of the app and then the github button on the app bar.

2. Make sure **Node.js version 14** is installed on the master machine by running:
```bash
node -v
```
3. The output should look someting like `v14.17.5`, if this is not the case use the following link for tips on how to install it:

4. After Node.js is installed, Install pm2 on master machine. Run command:
```bash
