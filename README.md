# Liquid Galaxy Retro Gaming

The idea of playing games on the Liquid Galaxy has already been explored by some developers, there are currently two classic retro games that have been implemented: pong and snake, but there is no easy way to install and run these games on a Liquid Galaxy. By creating a basic app with icons representing each game any person with a tablet could easily control which game is being displayed on the screens and even quickly switch between them.
